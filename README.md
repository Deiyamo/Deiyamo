🎓 My name is Timoté. I am still at school, in my 3rd year in Engineering & Computer Science (specialized in mobility and IOT). I will be graduating from my bachelor's degree in mid-2022.

📚 I'm currently learning Swift, Android and Node.js by building APIs. Actually, I just did finish a group project where we had to build a Swift app and link it to an API that already exists. 

👾 Apart from coding for school or for myself, I love to drink bubleteas and playing video games. The last two I played are Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077.

✈️ Localted in France, I love travelling...
